# Device Care

A personal wiki of device troubleshooting guides, organized as browsable markdown files on GitHub.

## What is this?

Device Care is a simple, low-tech solution for storing the troubleshooting steps that you always have to Google every time something stops working. Instead of bookmarking videos or searching Reddit again, you write down what actually worked—once.

## Structure

Guides are organized in a folder hierarchy:

```
devices/{category}/{subcategory}/{brand-model}/{guide}.md
```

**Example:**
```
devices/
└── audio/
    └── headphones/
        └── sony-wi-c310/
            └── pairing-iphone.md
```

## Current Guides

- **[Sony WI-C310 Bluetooth Pairing](devices/audio/headphones/sony-wi-c310/pairing-iphone.md)** — How to pair (or re-pair) these headphones with an iPhone

## Adding a New Guide

1. Create the folder path: `devices/{category}/{subcategory}/{brand-model}/`
2. Add a markdown file describing the problem and solution
3. Include: device info, numbered steps, and a troubleshooting table if helpful

## Why Markdown on GitHub?

- **Always accessible** — Works from any device with a browser
- **Version controlled** — See what changed and when
- **No account needed** — Just browse the repo
- **Easy to update** — Edit directly on GitHub or locally
