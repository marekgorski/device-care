# Pairing Sony WI-C310 with iPhone

**Device:** Sony WI-C310 (or WI-C200) neckband-style Bluetooth headphones

**Problem:** Headphones won't show up or connect to iPhone via Bluetooth

---

## Why This Happens

The most common reason these stop connecting to an iPhone is that they are in "Power On" mode rather than "Pairing Mode." Even if the light is blinking blue, it might not be the right kind of blinking for your iPhone to see it.

## Step 1: Trigger the "7-Second" Pairing Mode

Your headphones need to be "discoverable" for your iPhone to find them. If you just press the power button until they turn on, they will only try to connect to the last device they were used with.

1. Turn the headphones **OFF** first
2. Press and hold the **Power button** for at least **7 seconds**
3. Don't let go when you hear "Power On" — keep holding until:
   - The blue indicator light flashes twice in a row (flash-flash... flash-flash), OR
   - You hear the voice say "Bluetooth pairing"
4. Check your iPhone's **Settings > Bluetooth** menu — the headphones should appear at the bottom under "Other Devices"

## Step 2: "Forget" the Device on your iPhone

If your iPhone "sees" the headphones but says "Connection Unsuccessful," your phone might be holding onto a glitched connection record.

1. Go to **Settings > Bluetooth** on your iPhone
2. Find your Sony headphones in the list and tap the blue **ⓘ** icon next to the name
3. Tap **Forget This Device**
4. Turn Bluetooth **OFF** and then **ON** again on your iPhone
5. Repeat the 7-second hold on your headphones (Step 1) to try pairing fresh

## Step 3: Hard Reset the Headphones

If the light isn't behaving or they still won't show up, you can factory reset the headphones to clear their memory.

**To Reset:**
1. Make sure headphones are disconnected from the charging cable and turned **OFF**
2. Press and hold the **Power button** and the **Volume –** (minus) button simultaneously for about **7 seconds**
3. The indicator light will flash blue **four times**
4. This wipes all pairing info — you will need to pair them to your iPhone as if they were brand new

## Quick Troubleshooting Table

| Light Status | Meaning | Solution |

| Blinking Blue (Slow) | Searching for last device | Hold Power for 7s to enter pairing mode |
| Blinking Blue (Double) | Pairing Mode Active | Look for them in iPhone Bluetooth settings |
| Blinking Red | Battery is low | Charge for 10 minutes and try again |
| No Light | Battery dead or Off | Charge via USB-C cable |
