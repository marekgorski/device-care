## Press Release

### Personal Device Wiki Brings Order to Household Tech Chaos

*A simple, browsable collection of device guides — no apps, no accounts, just markdown.*

**December 2024** — Device Care is a personal knowledge base for device troubleshooting, maintenance, and usage instructions. It's a hierarchical folder structure of markdown files, browsable via GitHub.

**The Problem:** Device manuals get lost. Troubleshooting steps discovered through trial and error vanish from memory. The same Bluetooth pairing issue gets re-Googled every six months.

**The Solution:** A Yahoo-directory-style folder tree where each device gets its own folder, and each common task gets its own guide. Navigate by clicking through categories until you find what you need.

**How It Works**

1. Browse to the device category (audio, hvac, lighting, etc.)
2. Drill down to the specific device
3. Find the guide for your task (pairing, reset, maintenance, etc.)
4. Follow the steps

**Built for Personal Use**

No authentication, no database, no hosting costs. Just a Git repo you can access from any device with a browser.
