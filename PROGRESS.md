## Session: 2025-12-28 — Task Ownership Handoff System

### What Was Accomplished

**Added human/AI task handoff system:**

1. **ROLE_PROTOCOL.md** — Added task ownership markers section
   - `[C]` Claude can complete
   - `[M]` Marek must complete  
   - `[C→M]` Claude prepares, Marek executes
   - `[M→C]` Marek decides, Claude implements
   - Updated `..builder`/`..go` to check MAREK.md
   - Updated `..architect`/`..start` to flag stale `[M]` tasks

2. **MAREK.md** — Restructured with status sections
   - ⏸️ Blocked (needs Marek action)
   - ✅ Ready for Marek (Claude prepared)
   - ❓ Waiting on Marek Decision
   - 🔄 Ongoing Tasks
   - ✅ Completed

3. **TODO.md** — Added markers to all tasks
   - All `[C]` tasks have AC
   - Human tasks referenced to MAREK.md
   - Added "Blocked by" notes for dependent tasks

### Files Updated
